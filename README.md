# Gato-hashcracker üîì

Crack SHA and MD5 hashes using wordlists of your liking! This is a (scarily) simple tool coded in Python that allows you to crack hashes from the following hash algorithms:

- MD5
- SHA-512
- SHA-384
- SHA-256
- SHA-224
- SHA-1

The software allows you to launch a dictionary attack using two text files, a wordlist (a bunch of different passwords that you suspect might be the hash) and a list of hashes (that you want to crack). The software obtains every password in the wordlist and puts it through every hash algorithm mentioned. If a match is found, the software will tell you what type of hash it is, and it will tell you what the original input is (revealing the password).

*Disclaimer: this tool is meant for cybersecurity purposes. It is NOT meant to be used for any kind of criminal activity. The creator of this software holds no responsibility for any misuse of the software.

## How to use it üíª

You need a wordlist and a list of hashes. It really isn't much more complicated than that. The only two libaries the code uses is the os and hashlib modules, and both of those are included in the standard Python libaries.

## How do I obtain a wordlist? üß†

A wordlist is a list of passwords. You can obtain high quality wordlists by doing the following:

- Searching for them on websites and via search engines
- Downloading files that contain lists of passwords (some wordlists are VERY large and may take up a lot of storage on your device so make sure to optimize your storage)
- Generating wordlists based on content such as keywords (you can do this with tools)
- Finding wordlists on forums, message boards and other social networks
- Creating your own wordlists (not recommended as it may take a long time to do without automation)

## High quality info about wordlists: üìã

- A user named kkrypt0nn made a HUGE list of different wordlists to use. You can find them in the GitHub repository here: https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/wordlists?tab=readme-ov-file
- Rockyou.txt is one of the most famous wordlists in the world. You can download it here: https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt
- D4N155 is a wordlist generation tool that generates wordlists based on the content of webpages. Learn about it here: https://github.com/OWASP/D4N155
- Websites like Reddit and other social networks have information about wordlists and other cybersecurity related content.

## Final Statements ‚úçÔ∏è

Thank you for checking out my hash cracker! Star this repo.. or don't. That's fine too. Cya!
